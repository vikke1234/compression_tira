# Tests
Not sure how exactly you want this document to look like.
But the tests have been written to [src/tests/HeapTest.cpp](src/tests/HeapTest.cpp),
with descriptions for each test case.

## What has been tested
### vectors
- pushing back
- getting
- front
- back

### heaps
- inserting
- popping

### bitstring
- Encoding
- shifting left 
- bitwise OR 
- bitwise AND
- comparing


Shifting right isn't tested because it's not needed.
