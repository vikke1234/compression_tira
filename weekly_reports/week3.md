# Weekly report 3

## What happened during week 3
- Huffman coding file i/o

## Problems
- Figuring out how to actually encode the bits as compactly as possible
though it should be mostly done I think?
- It's a little tricky to reconstruct the tree, it may be because I wrote it wrong to file though

## Next week
Basically the same as last week since I didn't manage to actulally get it made

- Implement lempel ziv 77

## Hours spent
~20 hours
