# Weekly report 1

## What happened during week 1
- Project started
- Version control done
- Rough design

## Problems
It was hard to set up cmake correctly due to not that much experience with it.
Though it should be ish fine for now, will need to fix it though to work with
CxxTest since I doubt I set it up correctly.

## Next week
I will start with implementing the necessary classes (probably trees and some vector).

## Hours spent
~5 hours probably
