# Weekly report 2

## What happened during week 2
- Huffman coding mostly implemented
- Some unit testing, though the huffman coding doesn't have any public functions to test yet

## Problems
- It was a little hard to grasp how the huffman coding encodes the codebook[^1]


## Next week
- Implement one of the lempel ziv
- Make writing the Huffman coding to file
- Implement the necessary data structures (priority queue at least, the rest would probably work fine with a static array)

## Hours spent
~15-18 hours
