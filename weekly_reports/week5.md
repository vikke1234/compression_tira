# Week 5

## What was hard
- Getting the tree to read correctly
- Getting the data to go in the correct format and encoding the things into as small space as possible

## Next week
- The tests are mostly done for the data structures so I guess to fix the god damn compression it's full of small bugs...

## Hours spent
~35-40
